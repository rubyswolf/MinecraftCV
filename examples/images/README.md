Here's a set of random example images that you can use to try out the ~~edge/corner detection~~ and get a feel for how it works. Many feature nice crisp edges and corners for the optimal case but there's also two screenshots from Minecraft to show how it works in a more realistic setting. You can try it out with your own images as well, just select it in the full version or edit the python prototype code to point to your image file.

The impossible triangle is provided as an example for the vertex solver in the full version which should always cause vertex conflicts to show an unsolvable case.
